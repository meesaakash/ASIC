ASIC course chip design project

This project presents a Distance-Based Sorting Architecture inspired by the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm, commonly used in tasks like pattern recognition and object matching. 

By calculating Euclidean distances rather than relying on extensive parameter training, the architecture excels in efficient real-time applications such as facial recognition and similarity searches involving large datasets.
